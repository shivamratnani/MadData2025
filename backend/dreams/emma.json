But on way to look at it, road is blocked by huge boulders and lava comes bubbling from the hill. I barely make it inside the hosue. See muddy water rising from the gutter. Scared. I explore the house and find a gorgeous upstairs room in the shape of an oval with lots of windows! I imagine this as my own workroom, with an easel, typewriter, books and a crib! Very happy but outside I see huge boulders rumbling down and crushing people. Fear. Then water subsides and I start to take care of their son."

Also a box with jewels: beads and trinkets: in square box with zipper (like my leather jewel case) - then we talk more about alcohol and how it may help; warm feeling.\n(2) Dinner at our house: With the Pearsons (neighbors). Joyce Pearson (daughter) wants to knit a sweater: she somersaults over table where she will do it; Frank talking to friends; talk about XEROX. I look for a xerox copy that George gave us at Bible class; then I see Cindy and Gene (her husband) arrive at our house; Gene wearing glasses, looks like my father....(?) He is walking with a stick; limping. Find a chair for him and shake hands with sympathy. \"My back and arm hurt too,\" I say; Cindy and Vickie (her daughter) wait on couch while I put out candle stubs that have burnt very low on piano and other places. Also take down 2 prints from wall that I had tacked over painting over mantelpiece. Cindy says that \"letter you sent was not very appropriate.\" Something about Spain and marriage; finally we leave and go out to eat and talk."
