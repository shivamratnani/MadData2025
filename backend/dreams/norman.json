It was not the fittest that survived, but the most adaptable to change in environment. The dinosaurs were the fittest of their time, but became extinct when the climate was modified. I related that thought with my own inability to adapt to adulthood, and I believe that is why I felt so anxious. It made me ponder that adaptability is more essential to my survival than fitness or power to seduce. My power is useless if I can't adapt to adulthood.)"

Later I was in the aisle, and I undressed. Then I went back to my seat and I asked myself aloud why I had undressed. An officer was nearby. I dressed and went outside. A real estate man was driving a car that had a camera-like gadget in it and the car resembled a police car. I was sure it was a police car at first, and I wondered why the salesman was driving it. Later the officer I had seen inside came up to me and said I should pray. I walked toward a bus stop to catch a bus. When I had gone a ways, I noticed that I had passed my usual corner. I missed the bus. I caught another bus and asked if it was going to Long Island. A woman answered no, but she said she would phone and find out how I could get there. She told another woman to phone. She was a giddy young blonde lady. As she phoned, she giggled in a silly way."
